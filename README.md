# University of Cambridge MET IIB - Siemens Motion Control Congleton 4 Week Project

## Company Background
Siemens is a German multinational manufacturer founded in 1847. Siemens Motion Control, based in Congleton, manufactures variable speed drives used to control electric motors. Industry 4.0 has been a key focus for Siemens, with large investments being made into automation, Digitalisation and Electrification outlined in the “Vision 2020” strategy (Siemens, 2020).

## Project Background
Siemens Motion Control produce motor drives which can be used to control the speed and a variety of electric motors. These range in size from the G120C FSAA to the G120X. The G120C FSAA, makes up 73% of the units produced and tested in value stream 1 and is the highest volume unit produced on site.

This project, part of the Cambridge Manufacturing Engineering Tripos IIB course, aims to automate the product testing process of the G120C FSAA.
